# Cursor AI Rules for CCLABS

## Project Overview
This is the CCLABS repository. When working in this codebase, please follow these guidelines:

## Dominat8 / ai-command-center — Linear Single-Source Model
For the **ai-command-center** app (Nexus visuals, Autonomous Command, Empire Expansion, Content Creator):

- **One File Rule:** Apply all changes to **App.js only. No branching.** Do not create new component files or split code into separate modules; keep the single-source layout so Vercel deployments stay clean and predictable.
- **Index before big scripts:** The user may type **@App.js** in Composer before a large change so the AI has the latest version of the code. Assume App.js is the source of truth for this app.
- **Checkpoints:** After major scripts, the user will Accept All, verify the design, and Commit to GitHub. Treat each such commit as a checkpoint; avoid suggesting refactors that would undo or conflict with that checkpoint without good reason.

## Code Style and Standards
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow standard coding conventions for the language being used
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

## Development Workflow
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear commit messages
- Test changes before committing
- Follow the existing project structure

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- Provide clear explanations for code changes
- Suggest improvements when appropriate
- Help identify potential bugs or issues
- Assist with debugging and troubleshooting

## Best Practices
- Prioritize code readability over cleverness
- Consider performance implications
- Handle errors gracefully
- Write reusable and modular code
